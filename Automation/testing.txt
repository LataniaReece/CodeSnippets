Subject: Python Testing Email  
Message:
Hey Tania,

This is a python testing email to see what happens when I attach an email.
I want to write alot in the message to see what is captured. This is a test
and I want this to be pretty lengthy. Ok, I think that this is lengthy
enough. Will stop here. Could have just used Lorem Ipsum but I wanted to
know the words. I did study Latin. Whatever.

Thanks,
