Hey Tania,



This is a python testing email to see what happens when I attach an email.

I want to write alot in the message to see what is captured. This is a test

and I want this to be pretty lengthy. Ok, I think that this is lengthy

enough. Will stop here. Could have just used Lorem Ipsum but I wanted to

know the words. I did study Latin. Whatever.



Thanks,

Latania

Google Analytics will help you analyze everything that is happening on your

The Google Keyword Planner is the best way to find new keywords for your
website. You can use the Google Keyword Planner to find the most popular

the Keyword Planner to be the number 1 keyword research seo tool.

This week, we are making our own task manager for better interaction with
each other. Building and using our own software is the first step in our
software development cycle. You can find a vague model of our software
development cycle in the Entreprogrammer starting guide. We will act as the
alpha customer for our own task manager.


Right now I'm doing industry research and writing a UML for the project.
This software will be a subscription-based software ranging from free-$100
a month. We may charge a one time fee from $35-$200. We won't really have a
good pricing strategy until I've done more R and D (Research and
development. We can have a beta model working in less than 2 weeks. Upon
completion, we will use and test the application. I will also take that
time to teach you both about unit testing and deploying software.

throughout the creation of this software, we will get to practice our Flask
and python skills, we'll get an introduction to PHP, and tons of
OOP(object-oriented programming), and object creation, which is the core of
web programming and modern programming.

To prepare yourself for the challenge, learn more about GET and POST as an
HTTP verb. Remember we are trying to be agnostic programmers so don't think
of GET or POSTt as part of the Languages we are learning, but rather, think
of it as a part of Computer science since all languages use HTTP verbs.

*#Your meeting:* will be int the forms of these videos. If we were to meet
with me regarding these topics, I would talk for an uncontrol amount of
time with no restraint. When watching the videos, do not over-consume them.
These videos are all high-level overview and introductory videos. Do not
take notes or attempt to dive deeper.  We have more important things to
learn like python, Django, Flask, SQL, selenium, and PHP.  Only dedicate 2
hours to this task. When you start watching the video,  send me an email.
When you finish watching the video send me an email. Any remaining videos
will be transferred to next week 2-hour meeting. The order of the videos is
not important so watch in any order. Please keep track of the videos you've
watched and send an email of the video you didn't watch.

The Google Keyword Planner is the best way to find new keywords for your
website. You can use the Google Keyword Planner to find the most popular

the Keyword Planner to be the number 1 keyword research seo tool.

This week, we are making our own task manager for better interaction with
each other. Building and using our own software is the first step in our
software development cycle. You can find a vague model of our software
development cycle in the Entreprogrammer starting guide. We will act as the
alpha customer for our own task manager.


Right now I'm doing industry research and writing a UML for the project.
This software will be a subscription-based software ranging from free-$100
a month. We may charge a one time fee from $35-$200. We won't really have a
good pricing strategy until I've done more R and D (Research and
development. We can have a beta model working in less than 2 weeks. Upon
completion, we will use and test the application. I will also take that
time to teach you both about unit testing and deploying software.

throughout the creation of this software, we will get to practice our Flask
and python skills, we'll get an introduction to PHP, and tons of
OOP(object-oriented programming), and object creation, which is the core of
web programming and modern programming.

To prepare yourself for the challenge, learn more about GET and POST as an
HTTP verb. Remember we are trying to be agnostic programmers so don't think
of GET or POSTt as part of the Languages we are learning, but rather, think
of it as a part of Computer science since all languages use HTTP verbs.

*#Your meeting:* will be int the forms of these videos. If we were to meet
with me regarding these topics, I would talk for an uncontrol amount of
time with no restraint. When watching the videos, do not over-consume them.
These videos are all high-level overview and introductory videos. Do not
take notes or attempt to dive deeper.  We have more important things to
learn like python, Django, Flask, SQL, selenium, and PHP.  Only dedicate 2
hours to this task. When you start watching the video,  send me an email.
When you finish watching the video send me an email. Any remaining videos
will be transferred to next week 2-hour meeting. The order of the videos is
not important so watch in any order. Please keep track of the videos you've
watched and send an email of the video you didn't watch.

actually, skip the call I just need an update and any new code regarding
mongo that you may have. I want to see where you are at and what you've

 Question, how would you get the computer track if you aren't doing
anything? Like what if I left my screen for 5 mins to go to the bathroom or
something?

if you remember I told you how I would do this but this simple function
would be implemented differently by each dev. This is what coding is about.
We all know syntax and rules but can you put the right concepts together to
make this a reality. I'll send you my response by video but for now, I
return the question to you.
